Django Rest Framework
--------------------------

1. Difference between makemigrations and migrate
    makemigrations --> Generate SQL code
    migrate --> execute the sql code and automatically databse table will be created.

2. Performing CRUD operations by using webAPI without REST Framework.

3. Performing Retreive operations:
    --> get particular record based on particular matched id
    --> get all records

4. Whenever we send a request from client to server, server will procide response. It will provide status code.
    This status code represent status of response.
    Possible status Codes:
        1XX     100-199     Informational   (e.g. don't close browser etc.)
        2XX     200-299     Successful  
        3XX     300-399     Re-directional  (e.g. redirect to another site. )
        4XX     400-499     Client Error    (e.g. 404 Page not found)
        5XX     500-599     Server Error    (e.g. Server down )

5. Serialization : Converting python dict to json object. (one form to another form)
    --> serializers : inbuilt django module
    -->serialize() : convert queryset to json easily.
        -->  json_data = serializers.serialize('json',queryset)
