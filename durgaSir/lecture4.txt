Django Rest Framework
--------------------------

1.  Common language : Http
    Common Message Format : JSON/ XML

2.  --> When POST request is encountered, CsrfViewMIddleware of django 
        will check if Csrf token is present or not.
    --> How to BY-pass csrf verification:
        2.1. This can be done by commenting out the CsrfViewMIddleware in settings.py. (Not Recommended!)
    --> *args vs **kwargs
        *args : variable length arguments
            --> you can pass any number of arguments.
            --> it converts the arguments into tuple.

            Example : 
                def f1(*args):
                    print(args)
                
                f1()
                f1(10)
                f1(10,20)

                Output:
                >>> (10, 20)
                
        **kwargs : variable length keyword arguments
            --> you can pass any number of key-value arguments.
            --> it converts the arguments into dictionary.

            Example : 
                def f2(**kwargs):
                    print(kwargs)
                
                f1(name="Ashish", id=02, gf1="Luna",gf2="Hermione")

                Output:
                >>> {'name': 'Ashish', 'id': 2, 'gf1': 'Luna', 'gf2': 'Hermione'}

3.  Mixins : Mixed-In
    --> It is a independant class.
    --> To provide functionality to child class but not to parent class (itself).
    --> we won't create object for mixin.
    --> Code-Reusability.
    --> Like abstract class.
    --> direct child class of object. (biggest advantage :)
    --> it doesn't containg any instance variables.

    Mixins                    
    ----------------------                   
    1. Parent class instantiation not possible.            
    2. Parent class contains only instance methods but not instance variables.
    3. Methods Useful for only child class.
    4. parent class should be direct child class of object.

    example : Bachelor person. ;)

    Mutiple Inheritance
    -----------------------
    1. Parent class instantiation possible.            
    2. Parent class contains both instance methods and instance variables.
    3. Methods Useful for both parent and  child class.
    4. parent class can extend any other class also need not to be object class.

    example : married person :(
